Java Socket Programming Examples

http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/javanetexamples/


We will look at four network applications, written completely from scratch in Java. We will see that we can write these programs without any knowledge of the technologies under the hood (which include operating system resources, routing between networks, address lookup, physical transmission media, etc.)

Each of these applications use the client-server paradigm, which is roughly

One program, called the server blocks waiting for a client to connect to it
A client connects
The server and the client exchange information until they're done
The client and the server both close their connection
The only pieces of background information you need are:

Hosts have ports, numbered from 0-65535. Servers listen on a port. Some port numbers are reserved so you can't use them when you write your own server.
Multiple clients can be communicating with a server on a given port. Each client connection is assigned a separate socket on that port.
Client applications get a port and a socket on the client machine when they connect successfully with a server.
The four applications are

A trivial date server and client, illustrating simple one-way communication. The server sends data to the client only.
A capitalize server and client, illustrating two-way communication. Since the dialog between the client and server can comprise an unbounded number of messages back and forth, the server is threaded to service multiple clients efficiently.
A two-player tic tac toe game, illustrating a server that needs to keep track of the state of a game, and inform each client of it, so they can each update their own displays.
A multi-user chat application, in which a server must broadcast messages to all of its clients.

 * A server program which accepts requests from clients to
 * capitalize strings.  When clients connect, a new thread is
 * started to handle an interactive dialog in which the client
 * sends in a string and the server thread sends back the
 * capitalized version of the string.
 *
 * The program is runs in an infinite loop, so shutdown in platform
 * dependent.  If you ran it from a console window with the "java"
 * interpreter, Ctrl+C generally will shut it down.
