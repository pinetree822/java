Java Socket Programming Examples

http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/javanetexamples/


We will look at four network applications, written completely from scratch in Java. We will see that we can write these programs without any knowledge of the technologies under the hood (which include operating system resources, routing between networks, address lookup, physical transmission media, etc.)

Each of these applications use the client-server paradigm, which is roughly

One program, called the server blocks waiting for a client to connect to it
A client connects
The server and the client exchange information until they're done
The client and the server both close their connection
The only pieces of background information you need are:

Hosts have ports, numbered from 0-65535. Servers listen on a port. Some port numbers are reserved so you can't use them when you write your own server.
Multiple clients can be communicating with a server on a given port. Each client connection is assigned a separate socket on that port.
Client applications get a port and a socket on the client machine when they connect successfully with a server.
The four applications are

A trivial date server and client, illustrating simple one-way communication. The server sends data to the client only.
A capitalize server and client, illustrating two-way communication. Since the dialog between the client and server can comprise an unbounded number of messages back and forth, the server is threaded to service multiple clients efficiently.
A two-player tic tac toe game, illustrating a server that needs to keep track of the state of a game, and inform each client of it, so they can each update their own displays.
A multi-user chat application, in which a server must broadcast messages to all of its clients.

A Two-Player Networked Tic-Tac-Toe Game






The server

TicTacToeServer.java
package edu.lmu.cs.networking;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

/**
 * A server for a network multi-player tic tac toe game.  Modified and
 * extended from the class presented in Deitel and Deitel "Java How to
 * Program" book.  I made a bunch of enhancements and rewrote large sections
 * of the code.  The main change is instead of passing *data* between the
 * client and server, I made a TTTP (tic tac toe protocol) which is totally
 * plain text, so you can test the game with Telnet (always a good idea.)
 * The strings that are sent in TTTP are:
 *
 *  Client -> Server           Server -> Client
 *  ----------------           ----------------
 *  MOVE <n>  (0 <= n <= 8)    WELCOME <char>  (char in {X, O})
 *  QUIT                       VALID_MOVE
 *                             OTHER_PLAYER_MOVED <n>
 *                             VICTORY
 *                             DEFEAT
 *                             TIE
 *                             MESSAGE <text>
 *
 * A second change is that it allows an unlimited number of pairs of
 * players to play.
